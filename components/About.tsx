          <p>I'm a Computer Science major at Grand Valley State University
            as well as an aspiring Software Engineer who is
            currently focusing on Full Stack Web Development

          <p>I enjoy coding and doing anything that helps
            me improve my programming skills. I'm now delving into
            website development, but my interest stretches to
            Mobile Development and Machine Learning as well.
