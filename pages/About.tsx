            I'm a senior majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> at <b><a target="_blank" href="https://gvsu.edu">Grand Valley State University</a></b>.
            <br/><br/>
            Over the years, I've built strong technical skills in various programming languages
            and developed soft skills that help me excel in professional environments.
            <br/>
            I'm now focusing on <b>Web</b> and <b>Mobile Development</b> yet still leaving some space for exploring different fields to
            refresh my knowledge as well as being up-to-date to adapt to the fast-paced tech industry.
            <br/><br/>
            At the moment, I'm seeking a software engineering internship for Winter 2025,
            with the goal of securing a full-time position afterward.
            Iâ€™m eager to explore potential opportunities and how I can bring value to your team.
            Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect further.
