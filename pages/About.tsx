            <p>
              I'm a senior majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> at <b><a target="_blank" href="https://gvsu.edu" className='text-blue-800'>Grand Valley State University</a></b>.
              <br/><br/>
              Over the years, I've built strong technical skills in various programming languages
              and developed soft skills that help me excel in professional environments.
              I'm now focusing on <b>Web</b> and <b>Mobile Development</b> yet still leaving some space for exploring different fields to
              refresh my knowledge as well as being up-to-date to adapt to the fast-paced tech industry.
              <br/><br/>
              At the moment, I'm seeking a software engineering internship for Winter 2025,
              with the goal of securing a full-time position afterward.
              Iâ€™m eager to explore potential opportunities and how I can bring value to your team.
              Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect further.
